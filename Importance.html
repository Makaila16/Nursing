    <h1> Importance </h1>
    <p> The importance of me becoming a nurse means so much to me, I've seen and heard about how nurses have disrespected certain patients and made them extremely uncomfortable and that absoulety breaks my heart. I never want people to feel uncomfortable and feel disrespected by the people who are supposed to ensure your health and make sure you're okay. It's so important that when going into the medical field we make sure that's actually want we want to do because when you slowly don't truly want to take care of people anymore you slowly start to stop caring about the patients all together. </p>
