    <h1> Why </h1>
    <p> I want to become a nurse specifcally helping babies and soon to be mothers because I truly love babies and want to make sure they're okay and have everything they need. I also want to ensure soon-to-be mothers that safetsy and security during such a vunerable time for them; I'd like to make sure that not only the mothers are safe and healthy but so are their babies as well. I want to be those nurses who make their patients feel extremley comfortable to the point they can tell me anything and make sure the patients family is comfortable with me as well, I want to ensure my patients that safe space and privacy when I'm taking care of them.</p>
